### GNNs
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models that are designed to work with graph-structured data. They are an extension of traditional neural networks, which were originally developed for processing vector-based data such as images, text, or time series.

GNNs are motivated by the observation that many real-world problems can be modeled as graphs, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between them.
